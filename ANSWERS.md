1. What is the DOM?

    Document Object Model: object representation of HTML elements of a webpage

2. What is an event?

    An event is every interaction the end user has with a site (clicking/moving the mouse, scrolling the page, pressing a key on the keyboard, etc)

    A specific element that listents for a specific event and then fires a corresponding callback when that even occurs
